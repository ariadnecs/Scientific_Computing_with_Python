# Scientific_Computing_with_Python

Hello!
I will add some exercises from the course Scientific Computing with Python here. 
This is a wonderful freeCodeCamp course!
I highly recommend this course. Professor Dr. Chuck explains it very well and simply.
I think that you will love to learn python as I do.

"The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). 
He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development."
